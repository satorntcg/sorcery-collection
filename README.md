# SatornTCG

Internal inventory, listing, and sales-management platform for a trading card
game reselling business, covering Sorcery: Contested Realm and Riftbound.
Built as a client-side React SPA on top of Supabase (Postgres, Auth,
Realtime, and Edge Functions) — no separate backend.

## Features

- Two-channel listing management (eBay and TCGPlayer) with fee/profit math
- Automated price-move and stale-listing alerts
- Sealed box/pack purchase P&L and expected-value analytics
- AI-assisted lot grouping for listing creation (Anthropic API)
- Retrieval-augmented rules chatbot (OpenAI embeddings + Anthropic)
- Multi-game support with per-game vocabulary (rarities, sets, card types)
